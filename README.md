# Self-Driving Car with Neural Networks

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of a self-driving car using neural network concepts. The project aims to simulate an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating a predefined track using neural networks for perception and decision-making.



## Features

- Neural network-based perception system to interpret sensor inputs
- Decision-making module to determine appropriate actions based on perception
- Track simulation environment for testing and training the self-driving car
- Predefined track with various challenges and obstacles
- Visualization of the car's movement and perception in the track environment
- Training framework to optimize the neural network parameters

## Requirements

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- NPM (version X.X.X)
- WebGL-enabled browser (for visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ``` shell
   git clone https://github.com/Prureddy/Self_driving_car_javascript.git
   cd Self_driving_car_javascript
   npm install
   
##Usage

    Start the simulation environment:
    npm start
    This will launch the track simulation in your default web browser.
    Open the browser's console to view the car's perception and decision-making process.
    Interact with the simulation environment:
    Press the Start button to begin the car's autonomous driving.
    Use the arrow keys to manually control the car.
